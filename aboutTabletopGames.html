          This club is a lot of things, but it can be best described with a
          quote from the club's founder, Ryan Groneck, from the club's
          introduction. It says,
        </p>
        <div class="quotedText">
          <p>
            "The Tabletop Games Club is going to be a low-commitment club where
            we meet once a month to play card games, board games, and tabletop
            RPGs. These meetings are 2.5 hours long but feel free to leave early
            or arrive after we start. We will have a variety of board games
            sourced from the school library as well as from my own collection,
            and feel free to bring your own games too!"
